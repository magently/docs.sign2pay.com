#Payments

Authature provides for two seperate payment related scopes - Preapproval & Payment. In addition to verifying the users signature, these scope also handle collection of their Bank Account detail.

##Preapproval

Originally dubbed as, _Payments Like Uber_, this scope allows the **user** to link their bank account to your application, and sign a legal SEPA Mandate. Which, in turn, allows **you** to make preapproved payment requests at anytime, without requiring the users signature authentication.

##Payment

The payment scope is closest to a traditional e-commerce model where the user is in a checkout flow, and payment is authorised and captured in one go.
