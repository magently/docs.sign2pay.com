# JavaScript integration

We have two different versions of the JavaScript integration.

## Single page

You'll use this if you have a single-page application without page reloads, or if you have all shipping details ready before you start the payment process.

[Single Page](single_page.html)

## Multi page

Use this if your customers contact and shipping information has already been entered before they are sent to a seperate payment method page.

[Multi Page](multi_page.html)

## On-Demand

If you want/need control over when to initiate the Sign2Pay Risk Assessment, it is possible to call it from your own js, providing that all required param values are available.

[On Demand](on-demand.html)

## Callbacks

There are a few callbacks that you can use to hook into the Sign2Pay events when using the Javascript integration
